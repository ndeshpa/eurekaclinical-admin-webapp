/**
 * Destroys any session associated with this webapp. This has the effect of
 * logging the user out of the webapp without logging him/her out of CAS. As a
 * result, going to a page on the webapp will possibly log the user back in 
 * without needing to present credentials.
 * 
 * This is useful primarily for destroying the cookie associated with the 
 * webapp. You can bind a Guice provider to 
 * {@link DestroySessionServletJSPProvider}
 * that provides the path to a JSP page to show after the session has been
 * invalidated.
